        <h6 class="name">ANNIBALE.</h6>  <p class="speech">Ah, I don't think we can go into that.  It is a
  legal fiction, and legal fictions are solemn things.  Situated as
  we are, we can't recognize two independent responsibilities.</p>
        <h6 class="name">GIU.</h6>  <p class="speech">No; but you can recognize two independent appetites.
  It's all very well to say we act as one person, but when you
  supply us with only one ration between us, I should describe it
  as a legal fiction carried a little too far.</p>
        <h6 class="name">ANNI.</h6>  <p class="speech">It's rather a nice point.  I don't like to express an
  opinion off-hand.  Suppose we reserve it for argument before the
  full Court?</p>
