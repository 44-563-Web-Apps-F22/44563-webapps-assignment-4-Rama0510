    <h3>The Gondoliers Act 2</h3>
    <h4>
        ACT II<br>
        <h4>SCENE.—Pavilion in the Court of Barataria.  Marco and
          Giuseppe, magnificently dressed, are seated on two thrones,
          occupied in cleaning the crown and the sceptre.  The Gondoliers
          are discovered, dressed, some as courtiers, officers of rank,
          etc., and others as private soldiers and servants of various
          degrees.  All are enjoying themselves without reference to social
          distinctions—some playing cards, others throwing dice, some
          reading, others playing cup and ball, "morra", etc.</h4>
      <pre>CHORUS OF MEN with MARCO and GIUSEPPE.

          <p class="song">Of happiness the very pith
                         In Barataria you may see:
          A monarchy that's tempered with
                         Republican Equality.
          This form of government we find
          The beau ideal of its kind—
          A despotism strict combined</p>
                         <p class="direction">[_With absolute equality!_]</p>

                       MARCO and GIUSEPPE.

          <p class="song">Two kings, of undue pride bereft,
                         Who act in perfect unity,
          Whom you can order right and left</p>
                         <p class="direction">[_With absolute impunity._]</p>
          <p class="song">Who put their subjects at their ease
          By doing all they can to please!
          And thus, to earn their bread-and-cheese,
                         Seize every opportunity.</p>

<h6 class="name">CHORUS.</h6>   Of happiness the very pith, etc.

     <h6 class="name">MAR.</h6>  <p class="speech">Gentlemen, we are much obliged to you for your
expressions of satisfaction and good feeling—I say, we are much
obliged to you for your expressions of satisfaction and good
feeling.</p>
     <h6 class="name">ALL.</h6>  <p class="speech">We heard you.
     MAR.  We are delighted, at any time, to fall in with
sentiments so charmingly expressed.</p>
     <h6 class="name">ALL.</h6>  <p class="speech">That's all right.</p>
     <h6 class="name">GIU.</h6>  <p class="speech">At the same time there is just one little grievance
that we should like to ventilate.</p>
     <h6 class="name">ALL</h6> <p class="speech">(angrily)</p>.  <p>What?</p>
     <h6 class="name">GIU.</h6>  <p class="speech">Don't be alarmed—it's not serious.  It is arranged
that, until it is decided which of us two is the actual King, we
are to act as one person.</p>
     <h6 class="name">GIORGIO.</h6>  <p class="speech">Exactly.</p>
     <h6 class="name">GIU.</h6>  <p class="speech">Now, although we act as one person, we are, in point
of fact, two persons.</p></pre>
